  <p>Kozue Niseko invited us to photograph their penthouse apartment in the
  heart of Niseko. This beautiful space was a hidden gem with all the creature
  comforts of home and we loved capturing the wintery vibes with the fresh snow
  falling outside.&nbsp;</p>

  campaign-title: A penthouse on the slopes
  campaign-text_html: >-
    <p>This campaign involved a video walk-through of the property and a series
    of lifestyle images. We wanted to create imagery that would help the
    property stand out from the crown in a location where most luxury properties
    were only promoting empty venue shots, these curated lifestyle shots helped
    them to increase bookings the following season.&nbsp;</p>
