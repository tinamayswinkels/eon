  <p>At Acorn every dish is a piece of art, meticulously designed and with a
  story of its own, a chapter within the greater tale that is the 9-course set
  menu.&nbsp;<br /><br />We were invited to capture the mystery of the
  experience, a culinary journey and wine pairing.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>To capture the Acorn dining experience we attended as guests, shooting
    the experience as it was served. This meant ensuring that in the process of
    the photoshoot we were never disruptive to other paying diners, and that we
    used exclusively natural light with no artificial flash or
    lighting.&nbsp;<br /><br />We wanted to tell a story, showcasing the
    ambiance of the experience not just the food itself.&nbsp;</p>
