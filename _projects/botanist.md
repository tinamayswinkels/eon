    <p>The social media shoot for The Botanist's new floral collection was all
    about having a summer adventure. Feeling the sand under your feet and the
    wind in your hair.&nbsp;</p><p>We opted for a location that had a variety of
    textures and tones to add visual interest and a level of sophistication you
    wouldn't normally find with a beach photoshoot. The shoot included a mix of
    hero shots and close up detail shots to showcase the beautiful
    patterns.&nbsp;</p>
