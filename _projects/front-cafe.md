  <p>Front Cafe is a hidden gem in the heart of Pererenan (the cool sibling of
  Canggu) serving up delicious food, in a beautful space - a true local
  favorite.&nbsp;</p><p>As this shoot was right at the beginning of their
  opening, we had an opportunity to provide creative direction and a strong
  visual aesthetic for their social media moving forward.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>For a cafe shoot we're always looking to capture a couple of things -- to
    showcase the amazing food, highlight key dishes, capture the venue etc. But
    we're also looking for the little things that make a big difference in
    appealing to the target audience, like conveying the playful attitude of the
    venue or the friendly smile of the attentive staff.&nbsp;</p><p>We created
    key themes and repeatable elements that could carry the consistency through
    each month.&nbsp;</p>

  team-text-1_html: >-

    <p>The brand personality was playful, friendly and bright - a little bit of
    a Melbourne vibe in Bali.&nbsp;</p>
