  <p>Ethically sourced gemstones, diamonds and gold artisanal jewellery created
  by the talented Tara Noelle herself. She based herself in Bali and her designs
  are influenced by the beauty of the island.</p><p>For her lookbook shoot,
  though it's done in a studio, we wanted to bring out the island aspect that
  would really bring out the fine jewels itself. So we chose the locally sourced
  volcanic rocks and sand which gives the pieces a stunning contrast in the
  images.</p>
