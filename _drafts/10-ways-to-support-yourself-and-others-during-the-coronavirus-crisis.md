  Now, more than ever, we should take extra care not only with our physical
  health but also our mental health.

  <p>The coronavirus will have an effect on you one way or another.
  Unfortunately, the virus and its aftereffects have washed across the globe,
  affecting businesses, travel and leisure activities. There have been cases of
  infections in almost every country, resulting in lockdowns, restricted
  movement and widespread panic. Even if you are pretty sure you won&rsquo;t get
  the virus, just knowing about it and seeing updated statistics on almost all
  social channels can have you feeling exhausted, overwhelmed and
  unproductive.</p><p>Now, more than ever, we should take extra care not only
  with our physical health but also our mental health. Our moods and behaviours
  can indirectly affect those around us and when we decide to approach this
  coronavirus storm with calm, positivity and a clear mind, we can create a
  positive space filled with good vibrations for ourselves and others.</p>
main-paragraph-emphasis: Now is a good time to say those things you need to say
body-content_html: >-
  <ul><li><strong>Follow the rules of the country you are currently
  in</strong>&nbsp;for your own safety and those around
  you.</li><li><strong>Take a step back and turn your situation
  positive.</strong>&nbsp;Allowing negative emotions to fester because you are
  feeling upset or pressured can affect your mental health and productivity.
  Creating positive affirmations like &lsquo;I will get through this&rsquo; can
  make a big difference.</li><li><strong>Stick with your normal routine the best
  you can.</strong>&nbsp;Example: don&rsquo;t go into a panic because you cannot
  go to the gym anymore. Find a home exercise alternative and stick to your
  routine, this will help you to stay calm and productive.</li><li><strong>Reach
  out to loved ones.</strong>&nbsp;Now is a good time to say those things you
  need to say. You never know, the other person might just be needing your
  support more than you realise.</li><li><strong>Take a social media
  timeout&nbsp;</strong>to avoid cluttering your mind with inflated panic.
  Choose one valid resource to get your coronavirus information from and only
  allow yourself to check it once a day. If you feel the itch to check your
  socials more, look at a funny cat video instead.</li><li><strong>Make a
  &lsquo;worry-list&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>about what is freaking you out because
  of the virus. Writing it down and meditating over it will most likely have you
  realise you are overreacting and give you possible solutions to your
  worries.</li><li><strong>Create new healthy habits.</strong>&nbsp;Do more yoga
  self-practice, eat more vitamin-loaded fruits and vegetables, sleep more.
  These are good habits to improve not only your immune system but your overall
  health.</li><li><strong>Practice meditation and mindfulness</strong>&nbsp;with
  positive affirmations to keep yourself calm and productive during a
  crisis.</li><li><strong>Be grateful</strong>&nbsp;for what you have and
  realise that it is probably enough.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be
  selfish&nbsp;</strong>and panic buy. Leave some for everyone.</li></ul>
