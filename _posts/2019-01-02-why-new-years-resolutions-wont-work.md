  Starting the new year off with a few personal changes in mind always seem
  logical.

  <p>It&rsquo;s a new year, a new decade, full of infinite opportunities for
  self-growth and self-development. These changes also go by the name New
  Year&rsquo;s Resolutions. Come February, and you&rsquo;ve probably forgotten
  about most of them.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s 5 reasons why New Year&rsquo;s
  resolutions never survive the first month:</p><ol><li>Your resolutions or
  goals are just to big and unrealistic to achieve</li><li>Your resolutions are
  not actually&nbsp;<em>yours</em>. They are your perception of what you should
  change based on social media and the influence of other people</li><li>You are
  not motivated or determined enough to follow through on your
  resolution</li><li>You don&rsquo;t have a practical plan to achieve your
  resolution</li><li>You believe you will fail before you even try</li></ol>

      <p>So, what can you do differently this year to implement change in your
      life? It is actually easier than you think. It all starts with something
      small. Rather than setting a big unrealistic goal for yourself, break it
      down in smaller goals that can help you move towards your bigger end goal.
      Time management is also important. Even if you begin small, you
      consciously need to make time to get used to your new habit or behavioural
      pattern.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you would like to start exercising every
      day and follow a plant-based diet. If you jump right in with two hour gym
      sessions when you&rsquo;ve never done exercise in your life, followed by
      going vegan immediately, you will only end up with a stiff body, lacking
      energy and probably even some stomach troubles because of the drastic
      change in diet. If your new goals are making you feel bad, why continue
      with them?</p><p>Rather start small, taking into consideration time and
      budget. Start with planning thirty minutes of your day with mild exercise
      like walking, swimming or a Pilates class. Even if you manage just three
      times a week, that&rsquo;s still better than giving up. Analyse your
      progress after a month and then add on to your thirty-minute habit.
      Science have shown that linking a new habit to an existing good habit has
      a better chance of success. You can even link your exercise goal with your
      plant-based goal, i.e. after every workout session I will drink a smoothie
      or eat a vegan buddha bowl &ndash; no animal-based proteins.</p><p>If you
      want your New Year&rsquo;s resolutions and goals to succeed keep this in
      mind:</p><ul><li>Is this really your true goal? Ask yourself if you want
      to do this</li><li>Break it down into smaller manageable
      chunks</li><li>Manage your time</li><li>Pair new habits with old ones that
      are working for you</li><li>Surround yourself with like-minded people who
      encourage your goals</li></ul><p>This year try to make a real change by
      starting off small.&nbsp;</p>
